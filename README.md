### Course Description

This course highlights the research in analysis for social data and builds skills to undertake those analysis. It is a lab-intensive course intended to build up data analytic skills for novice and intermediate researchers. We start with reviews of recent studies using "big data" which are primarily theoretical, including critiques of data analytics and data ethics. We then cover several fields: health, strategic and consumer research, and politics. At the same time, we will be learning a programming language -- Python -- and learn how to scrape social data, store and collect it, run basic statistics, generate visuals, and create a report based on a project of interest.

By the end of this course, you should be able to do the following:

1. *Identify* potential social data sources which you can use to answer social scientific questions
2. *Collect* data sources for use in analysis
3. *Transform* data into a usable format
4. *Analyze* data using standard social scientific methods
5. *Visualize* data in informative ways

## Course Requirements

*Reading* - There will be no required textbooks for this course. All required reading will be posted to the UofT Learning Portal. The readings will focus on a number of topics: the emergence of the fields of big data and data science, uses of large-scale datasets for social scientific research, ethics of social trace data, and both popular and scholarly examples of cutting-edge data analysis work.

*Attendance* - This is a *lab-intensive* course, which means that I expect you to learn primarily through writing the code yourself. Because of that, it is important for you to attend labs and get experience programming different types of exercises. We will start lab assignments in class, but you are expected to complete them in your own time.

<!-- *Journals* - You will be expected to discuss programming concepts and readings on the Learning Portal. For each week, you should write a few sentences about the concept we are discussing in class that week. This can concern anything we discussed: the readings, the programming concept discussed in lecture, questions about particular problems you are having, etc. 
 -->

*Quizzes* - There will be a short quiz each day in the lecture portion of the class. The quiz will cover readings, code principles, and lab activities. 

*Exams* - There will be two exams which will focus on coding principles. The final exam will occur during the usual final exam period.

*Project* -

### Policies


### Academic Integrity

I understand that as the semester progresses, you will no doubt be juggling multiple class assignments, studying for exams, part-time paid work, and campus/community activism. This added stress can affect your well-being, emotions, and school performance. Therefore, time management early in the semester is part of the key to success in college. Avoid cutting corners and especially, avoid any type of behaviour (such as copying and pasting material from the internet without proper citation) that can be interpreted as plagiarism and academic misconduct. A clear definition of academic integrity as well as information about disciplinary sanctions for academic misconduct may be found at the University of Toronto Academic Integrity website ([http://academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/](http://academicintegrity.utoronto.ca/)) and the Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters ([http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/PDF/ppjun011995.pdf](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/Assets/Governing+Council+Digital+Assets/Policies/PDF/ppjun011995.pdf)). 

Students are expected to be aware of these guidelines and the related consequences. If I suspect academic misconduct, I will speak with the chair of the department, as well as the Dean, and a report written by me will be placed in your academic file detailing the circumstances. Avoid this painful hassle for everyone, manage your time wisely and do not knowingly (or ignorantly) plagiarize. If you are unclear on what constitutes plagiarism, please contact me well before the assignment is due.

### Equity and Academic Rights Information

The University of Toronto is committed to equity and respect for diversity. All members of the learning environment in this course should strive to create an atmosphere of mutual respect. As a course instructor, I will neither condone nor tolerate behaviour that undermines the dignity or self-esteem of any individual in this course and wish to be alerted to any attempt to create an intimidating or hostile environment. It is our collective responsibility to create a space that is inclusive and welcomes discussion. Discrimination, harassment and hate speech will not be tolerated. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns you may contact the [UTM Equity and Diversity officer](http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/equity-diversity/home) or the [University of Toronto Mississauga Students' Union Vice President Equity](http://utmsu.ca/contact-page/).

You, as a student at UTM, have the right to:

- Obtain a course syllabus either through accessing a copy on Blackboard, through the UTM Academic Timetable, Office of the Registrar website or one will be provided by the instructor. The course syllabus may be provided at the start of the course and absolutely no later than the last date to add courses.
- Rely upon a course syllabus. An instructor may only change marks' assignments by following the University Assessment and Grading Practices Policy provision 1.32.
- Refuse to use turnitin.com (you must be offered an alternative form of submission).
- Have access to your instructor for consultation during a course or follow up with the department chair if the instructor is unavailable.
- Ask the person who marked your term work for a re-evaluation if you feel it was not fairly graded. You have up to one month from the date of return of the item to inquire about the mark. If you are not satisfied with a re-evaluation, you may appeal to the instructor in charge of the course if the instructor did not mark the work. If your work is remarked, you must accept the resulting mark. You may only appeal a mark beyond the instructor if the term work was worth at least 20% of the course mark.
- Receive at least one significant mark (15% for H courses, 25% for Y courses) before the last day you can drop a course for H courses, and the last day of classes in the first week of January for Y courses taught in the Fall/Winter terms.
- Submit handwritten essays so long as they are neatly written.
- Have no assignment worth 100% of your final grade.
- Not have a term test worth 25% or more in the last two weeks of class.
- Retain intellectual property rights to your research.
- Receive all your assignments once graded.
- View your final exams. To see a final exam, you must submit an online Exam Reproduction Request within 6 months of the exam. There is a small non-refundable fee.
- Privacy of your final grades.
- Arrange for representation from Downtown Legal Services (DLS), a representative from the UTM Students' Union (UTMSU), and/or other forms of support if you are charged with an academic offence.
